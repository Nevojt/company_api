    Search for users and rooms based on a substring.

    Parameters:
    - `substring`: The substring to filter by. This parameter is case-insensitive.
    - `db`: The database session. It is injected by the `get_db` function.

    Returns:
    - A dictionary containing a list of users and rooms that match the search criteria.
      Each user is represented as a dictionary with the following keys:
      - `id`: The user's unique identifier.
      - `user_name`: The user's name.
      - `avatar`: The user's avatar URL.
      - `created_at`: The date and time when the user was created.
      Each room is represented as a dictionary with the following keys:
      - `id`: The room's unique identifier.
      - `owner`: The room's owner.
      - `name_room`: The room's name.
      - `image_room`: The room's image URL.
      - `count_users`: The number of users in the room.
      - `count_messages`: The number of messages in the room.
      - `created_at`: The date and time when the room was created.
      - `secret_room`: A boolean indicating whether the room is a secret room.

    The function uses SQLAlchemy's ORM to query the database and filter users and rooms based on the provided substring.
    It also counts the number of users and messages in each room.
