# Chat API for User Communication

## Overview:

This module serves as a pivotal segment of the main application, focusing primarily on facilitating user communication through a chat interface. The API is designed to securely hold user profiles, their chat histories, and other related data to ensure seamless and persistent chat experiences.

## Role & Responsibilities:

- **API Development**: I spearheaded the creation of the API, ensuring robust user data management and real-time message handling.

- **Data Management**: Ensured secure and efficient handling of user profiles and chat messages, reinforcing user trust and data integrity.

## Technology Stack:

- **Backend Development**: The core of the API is developed using `FastAPI` and `Python`, leveraging their agility and vast libraries.

- **Database Management**: Utilized `SQL` for structured data queries, with `SQLALCHEMY` as an ORM for efficient data operations. All data is hosted on a `PostgreSQL` database ensuring reliability and scalability.

- **Virtualization & Hosting**: The project is hosted on a virtual machine procured from `Google Cloud Platform`. 

- **Web Server**: For serving the main site, I employed the `Apache` server, known for its stability and performance.

- **Containerization**: The API is encapsulated within a `Docker` container running on the same virtual machine. This provides an isolated environment, ensuring consistency across deployments and scalability.

- **Operating System**: The entirety of this setup operates on a `Linux` environment, harnessing its security features and performance optimizations.

## Deployment:

The combination of a Google Cloud VM, the Apache server for the site, and the Docker container for the API ensures a high-availability, resilient, and scalable infrastructure. This setup guarantees users a reliable chat experience irrespective of the volume of concurrent users or messages.
